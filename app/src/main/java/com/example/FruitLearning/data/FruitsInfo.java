            new Fruit("Banana", "A banana is a tropical fruit that's quite popular all over the world. It grows in bunches on a banana tree. To \"go bananas\" is a slangy way of saying \"go crazy\" or act ridiculous, and if someone refers to the \"top banana,\" they mean the most important person in a particular group. The origin of banana isn't certain, but it's thought that it was borrowed by the Spanish or Portuguese from an African word, probably the Wolof word banana.", "images/banana.png", "0"),
            new Fruit("Guava", "Most guavas are green, with slightly bumpy skin, often ripening to a yellow or almost maroon color. Though a guava smells a lot like a lemon, its pale pink flesh and juice are sweet and mild, sometimes described as a cross between a ripe pear and a strawberry. Guavas are native to South America, Central America, and Mexico, and their name comes from an Arawakan word for \"guava tree.\"", "images/guava.png", "1"),
            new Fruit("Orange", "Oranges grow in warm places like Florida, California, and Brazil, where they are harvested to be eaten and made into juice and other products. The color of the orange, in varying hues, is also orange, a warm, sunny shade that falls between red and yellow on the color spectrum. The first orange trees probably grew in India, and the word itself has its roots in the Sanskrit naranga-s, \"orange tree.\"", "images/orange.png", "2"),
            new Fruit("Apple", "The apple isn't just a fruit. It's a symbol — from the apples eaten by Adam and Eve in the Biblical creation story, which symbolize the loss of innocent to the expression \"American as apple pie\" to mean something that is wholesome. The \"apple of your eye\" is the person who delights you — maybe you are the apple of your grandfather's eye. He might tell you, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away,\" meaning the fruit is good for your health.", "images/apple.png", "3"),
            new Fruit("Mango", "Like peaches and plums, mangoes have an inedible pit at the center. Unlike these other fruits, the skin of a mango is very tough and also inedible. Mangoes grow in the warm climate of South Asia, and are the official nationalal fruit of Pakistan, India, and the Philippines. This tasty fruit was first imported to North America in the 17th century in a pickled form. Mango comes from the Tamil word mankay, \"mango tree fruit.\"", "images/mango.png", "4"),
            new Fruit("Avocado", "It might seem strange that an avocado is a fruit, because it's not sweet. Avocados have to be cut open before you eat them, and the hard pit in the middle needs to be removed. The inside of an avocado is firm but soft, a pale green shade. The word avocado is Spanish, from aguacate, and rooted in a Proto-Aztecan word, *pawa, that also meant avocado.", "images/avocado.png", "5"),
            new Fruit("Papaya", "Most people eat papayas raw when the fruit is soft and ripe, although some find the smell of a perfectly ripe papaya to be terrible. Many Southeast Asian and South American cuisines include raw and cooked papaya, as well as green papaya and even the leaves of the papaya tree. Papayas are also called pawpaws, which gets a bit confusing since there's a totally different North American fruit also called a pawpaw.", "images/papaya.png", "6"),

The deep pink or red flesh of a watermelon, however, is uniquely sweet, juicy, and refreshing. Watermelons are originally native to Africa, and they were brought to North America and cultivated around the 16th century. For many people, it's just not summer without watermelon — the fruit is over 90 percent water, so it's not just delicious, but it also quenches your thirst.", "images/watermelon.png", "7"),
            new Fruit("Grapefruit", "The first grapefruits were an accident — they came from an inadvertent cross between an orange and a pomelo. Both of those species are native to Asia, but the grapefruit's accidental invention happened in Barbados some time in the 18th century. The name comes from the way the fruit clusters on the tree, close together like grapes, rather than its taste, which is a mixture of sweetness and acidity.", "images/grapefruit.png", "8"),
